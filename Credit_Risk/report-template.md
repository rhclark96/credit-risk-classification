## Overview of the Analysis

The analysis in this challenge was meant to test how well the created machine learning model could predict whether or not a loan was healthy or high-risk based on the borrower's financial information and the loan size. The financial information included the loan amount, interest rate for said loan, the total amount of debt for the borrower, the borrower's income, the borrower's debt-to-income ratio, the number of accounts held by the borrower, and the number of derogatory marks against the borrower. All of this information served as the features to train the machine learning to classify the loan status as either healthy or high-risk. This variable then helps lending services determine the creditworthiness of their loan applicants. 

In order to build the machine learning model, the initial data set of financial information was split using the 'train_test_split' function into multiple subcategories in both the predictors (financial information) and the variable (loan status). These subcategories of data allow for the model to learn and be trained from one set of data, while also providing an additional set of data that the model is unfamiliar with to use for analysis of the model's efficacy in predicting the loan status. From there, the training dataset was used to train the machine learning model using the 'LogisticRegression' function. Then using the second dataset, previously unfamiliar to the machine learning model, the model was used to predict the loan status of these additional data points, which was then compared to the actual outcomes. The comparison of the actual outcomes and the predictions from the machine learning model provides insight into the efficacy of the model. 

## Results

* Logistic Regression Model :
    * __Accuracy Score:__ The weighted average accuracy score for this model is 0.99, meaning the model can make accurate predictions of the loan status 99% of the time given the financial information is provided as input. The weighted accuracy score is appropriate to use in this scenario since the data is not balanced between the two possible outcomes, as there are significantly more 'Healthy Loan' outcomes than 'High-Risk Loan' outcomes.
    * __Precision Score:__ For the 'Healthy Loans', the precision score is 1.00, meaning the model can accurately predict healthy loans as being healthy loans 100% of the time and there is a low rate of false positives in this case. However, for the 'High-Risk Loans', the precision score is 0.87, meaning that there are more false positives for this outcome, and more loans will be flagged as high-risk when they may actually be healthy loans.
    * __Recall Score:__ For the 'Healthy Loans', the recall score is 1.00, meaning the model can accurately predict a healthy loan as being healthy 100% of the time even when considering false positives and false negatives. However, the recall score for the 'High-Risk Loans' is 0.95, meaning there are possibilities for false positives for this outcome when considering all of the predicted outcomes. This means that there is more of a possibility for loans to be flagged as 'high-risk' when it may actually be a healthy loan. 

## Summary

Overall, this model can be used quite accurately to predict the loan outcome for a borrower when using their pertinent financial information as input. Healthy loans are always identified as such, and high-risk loans are often identified correctly. With this recommendation for the use of this model to predict loan outcomes, there are two recommendations: train the model again using more data from high-risk loans, and/or have loans that are identified as 'high-risk' by the model be reviewed by a lending expert to ensure that the model did not produce a false-positive.
